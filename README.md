## [How to Use LeetCode Effectively](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IB_F10twtvY)

step 1: start by top 100 liked questions

step 2: focus on the questions by topic

step 3: order the questions from the highest to lowest acceptance rate

step 4: learn from the solutions

step 5: revisit the problems
(one or two weeks later until you are 100% confident to solve them )

step 6: solve company specific questions
